# 1. Addresses 
- Ethereum blockchain is made up of **accounts** (think bank account) 
- Account has a balance of **Ether** (currency used on Ethereum blockchain)
- Each account has an **address** (like a bank account number) 

# 2. Mappings 
- Way of storing organized data (like structs/ arrays) 
- A a key-value store for storing and looking up data. 
  - For a financial app, storing a uint that holds the user's account balance:
    - key (address), value (uint)
    ```
    mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
    ```
  - Or could be used to store / lookup usernames based on userId
    - key (uint), value (string)
    ```
    mapping (uint => string) userIdToName;
    ``` 
  - Note: address is a tyoe (refer above) 
- to set/change the value of mappings: 
  ```
  favoriteNumber[msg.sender] = _myNumber;
  ```
  - ^ The syntax for storing data in a mapping is just like with arrays
  
# 3. msg.sender (one of the **global variables** that are available to all functions) 
- refers to the address of the person (or smart contract) who called the current function.
> Note: In Solidity, function execution always needs to start with an external caller.
> A contract will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions.
> So there will always be a msg.sender.
- Using msg.sender gives you the security of the Ethereum blockchain
  â€” the only way someone can modify someone else's data would be to steal the **private key** associated with their **Ethereum address**.

# 4. require
- function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true.
> Side note: Solidity doesn't have native string comparison, so we
> compare their keccak256 hashes to see if the strings are equal
```
require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));
```

# 5. Contract Inheritance - like Java
- Can be used for logical inheritance (e.g. animal subsclass) or simply to organize code.
```
contract Doge {
  function 1 { 
  }
}

contract BabyDoge {
  function 2 {
  }
} 
```
- BabyDoge inherits from Doge - it will have access to any public functions we defined on Doge

# 6. import - to import a file (Javascript) 
```
import "./someothercontract.sol";
```

# 7. Storage vs Memory (Data location) 
- Storage - variables stored permanently on the blockchain
- Memory variables - temporary, erased between external function calls to your contract
- Need to use these keywords in **structs** and **arrays** within functions
```
Sandwich storage mySandwich = sandwiches[_index];
```
> mySandwich is a pointer to 'sandwiches[_index]' in storage and changing its value alter it on the blockchain permanently.
- If you just want a copy, can use: 
```
Sandwich memory anotherSandwich = sandwiches[_index + 1];
```
> anotherSandwich will a copy of the data in memory, modifying it will not affect the original data
> - However, to copy the changes back to blockchain storage:
>   ```
>   sandwiches[_index + 1] = anotherSandwich;
>   ```

# 8. internal and external functions
- Apart from public and private, Solidity also has these two visibility types for functions.
- **Internal**: same as private, but is also **accessible to contracts that inherit** from this contract.
- **External**: similar to public, but functions can ONLY be called outside the contract - can't be called by other functions inside the contract. 

# 9. To interact with other contracts -> need interface 
- for external contracts to access data
```
contract NumberInterface {
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
}
```
- We only declare the functions we want to interact with. 
- Don't mention other functions/ state variables.
- Not defining function body - ends with ;
- By defining interface, our contract knows what the other contract's function looks like, how to call them and what sort of respond to expect.

# 10. Using interface: 
```
contract MyContract {
  address NumberInterfaceAddress = 0xab38... 
  // ^ The address of the FavoriteNumber contract on Ethereum
  NumberInterface numberContract = NumberInterface(NumberInterfaceAddress);
  // Now `numberContract` is pointing to the other contract

  function someFunction() public {
    // Now we can call `getNum` from that contract:
    uint num = numberContract.getNum(msg.sender);
    // ...and do something with `num` here
  }
}
````

# 11. Handling Multiple Return Values
```
function multipleReturns() internal returns(uint a, uint b, uint c) {
  return (1, 2, 3);
}
...
// multiple assignment
(a, b, c) = multipleReturns();
// Or if we only cared about one of the values:
function getLastReturnValue() external {
  uint c;
  // We can just leave the other fields blank:
  (,,c) = multipleReturns();
}
```

### Notes - % 10^n 
- For a number, by % 10^n, we will get the last n-th number.
- E.g., 10500 % 1000 = 500
- 334455 % 100 = 55
